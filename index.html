                <p>If someone asked me to describe myself in three words, I would say that I am pragmatic, motiovated, and a hardcore nerd. OK, so that's technically four words, but the 'hardcore' was required.<br><br>I am one part researcher, one part gamer, and one part developer. I received my MSc in psychology from the University of Limerick in 2016 and proceeded to complete a PhD in psychology in 2019. I am currently a computer science MSc student with the hopes of leaving the world of academia for the software industry. I utilise this psychological background not only to discern the most important aspects of video games, but also to apply this knowledge to my own software development. </p>

                <p>I would like to develop accessibility software for the visually impaired. My eyesight is atrocious, and this causes me a multitude of issues when utilising various types of software. For my MSc thesis, I intend to develop a singular software that can adjust everything on the screen for the visually impaired. In a dream scenario, this will be picked up by Microsoft who will then implement it into their OS.</p>

                <br>
                <h4>If I could expand this website, what sections would I add? </h4>
                <p>I would separate the individual pieces of this singular page into separate tabs. This would allow me to have webpages that are dedicated to my work experience, portfolio, and education. A portfolio in particular is of utmost importance for the future.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What features would I like to implement if I gained more web development skills?</h4>
                <p>I would like to create a more interactive header that leads to other webpages such as my portfolio, as mentioned above. I would add gifs or videos on the landing page with examples of my previous work, such as my published game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568030/Too_Many_Cooks/"> Too Many Cooks</a>, on Steam.</p>   <!--Hyperlink to my published game Steam page-->

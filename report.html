<!--I developed my website using VSCode. I have probably more experience than some of the other students simply because I'm older and have already had career-type jobs. I've kept the website basic as per the assignment specifications, but I will expand it later and add an actual portfolio, etc. I have some projects I can display. 
I first did the boxified design using PowerPoint as it was easier for me to layout that way. I then handdrew it for the assignment. I used the lectures online as well as some YouTube CSS tutorials to get the site looking as nice as it is. I particularly like using different alpha values--a big block of a background colour just didn't look right.--->
